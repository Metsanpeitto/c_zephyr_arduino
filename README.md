# Zephyr - Prototype embedded systems

This firmware belongs to the Zephyr prototype. A device that through an airflow sensor and some algorithms, helps patients with lung issues to measure their capacity.

The sensor was a Honeywell, zephyr sensor and the device used an Atmega-328 with Arduino code, to capture the sensor data. process it and through a Bluetooth shield, transmit it to a server.

The device never passed from the prototype stage.
